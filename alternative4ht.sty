% Enable tex4ht to patch packages before \begin{document}
% configurations provided by .4ht files are used after \begin{document}
% so if some command which causes tex4ht to fail is used in the preamble,
% we have no chance to catch it
% with \altusepackage, we may choose to not include package at all, when tex4ht
% is running, or use special patch file in the form of packagename-alt4ht.sty
% normal \usepackage is used when tex4ht is not running
